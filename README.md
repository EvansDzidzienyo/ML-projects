### **Key Features**  
- **Objective:**  
  To build a predictive model capable of identifying mental health conditions in employees, thereby aiding in early intervention and support strategies.  

- **Data Scope:**  
  The dataset spans six continents and includes diverse features such as age, gender, stress level, hours worked per week, access to mental health resources, and more.  

- **Machine Learning Models Evaluated:**  
  - Logistic Regression (*final selected model*)  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting  
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  
  - Decision Tree  
  - K-Nearest Neighbor  

- **Model Performance:**  
  Models were assessed using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and generalization ability. Logistic Regression was chosen due to its balanced performance and high F1 score, making it the most suitable for deployment.

### **Results and Insights**  
1. **Logistic Regression** demonstrated strong performance on both training and test data, with an F1 score of **86.4%**, indicating reliability and generalization capability.  
2. **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** showed high accuracy but risked overfitting due to significantly better performance on training data compared to test data.  
3. The **confusion matrix** for the selected model highlighted its ability to minimize false negatives, making it a robust choice for early mental health condition detection.

### **Conclusion**  
This project highlights the potential of machine learning in promoting mental health awareness. By accurately predicting mental health conditions, the model serves as a tool for organizations to proactively address employee well-being, reduce workplace stress, and enhance productivity.
